# My Unix Profiles

After looking at [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), I was inspired to create some sort of version controlled copy of all of my unix/terminal 
settings. With this approach, all of my favorite settings can be recorded and maintained beyond the scope of a single computer. So if I ever need to set
myself up on a new system (a highly likely event), I can clone this repository and have an instantly familiar working environment!
